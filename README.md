Google University Outreach Quicksite
===============

This is a template I built for different Google programs specialists to quickly and easily get a website up and running for their event.  It's still in the workings so that it's even easier for people to build on, but it gets the job done in the time being.  Here is an example of the website I created for Google Helpouts and the event at San Francisco State University.
